## Comparing Cabal Files to Makefiles

Cabal files and Makefiles are both used to build projects, but they have distinct characteristics and use cases.

### Similarities
- **Build Instructions**: Both provide instructions for building projects.
- **Dependencies**: Both can specify project dependencies.
- **Targets**: Both can define various build targets, such as executables and libraries.

### Differences

#### Cabal Files:
- **Declarative**: Cabal is more about describing "what" to build rather than "how" to build it.
  - Descriptive of dependencies, modules, flags, etc.
  - Handles build processes internally.
- **Modern Configuration**: Similar to modern package management systems.
- **Analogs**:
  - **Python**: `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`
  - **JavaScript**: `package.json`
  - **Rust**: `Cargo.toml`
  - **Java**: `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle`

#### Makefiles:
- **Imperative**: Explicitly write build commands and rules.
  - Direct control over compile steps.
- **Script-Like**: More manual control over every aspect of the build system.
- **Example**:
  - "Run `ghc -o myprogram file1.hs file2.hs -package base`"

### Summary
- Cabal files serve a similar purpose to Makefiles but are more high-level and focused on project description rather than manual scripting.
- Cabal abstracts away complex build processes, making it easier to manage dependencies and configurations.

This distinction makes Cabal files easy to use for package management and building Haskell projects.
